// OAuth 1.0-based strategies require a `verify` function which receives the
// credentials (`token` and `tokenSecret`) for accessing the Twitter API on the
// user's behalf, along with the user's profile.  The function must invoke `cb`
// with a user object, which will be set at `req.user` in route handlers after
// authentication.

// Configure Passport authenticated session persistence.
//
// In order to restore authentication state across HTTP requests, Passport needs
// to serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  In a
// production-quality application, this would typically be as simple as
// supplying the user ID when serializing, and querying the user record by ID
// from the database when deserializing.  However, due to the fact that this
// example does not have a database, the complete Twitter profile is serialized
// and deserialized.
